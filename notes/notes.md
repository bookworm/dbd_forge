User should be able to list installed extensions .


# Dev    

The forge is going to be a separate service. That is public. The only thing available for users is a simple script. Will launch this first and profit from donations. No will just keep it a simple pay for use service.

This app will have an interface for adding extensions and the API. Separate signup site to use service. For now we just a use a simple signup page. This allows us to pivot to something greater but collect profits quickly. Singup and manage account. Collect support via lighthouse.
