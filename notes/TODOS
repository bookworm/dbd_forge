  No need for a for plan controller cause only one plan.
  
i will go with one accesskey one site for now.         
since an access key has pub and private we just return a singlekey from account. swap out methods later for mutle keys.
voila 

DO the key on the account/show page. click to regenerate

# Future                    
- buy artifacts
- wepay on users
- event hook for stripe pay.   
- rabl json views for api     
- downloads with permissions on artifacts    
  - generate download on artfiact. should create a zip file.           
- accounts page to manage keys. keys are "keyed" to a domain. hehe I made a pun.        
- file uploads on artifacts.   
- todo details about incompatibilities. not sure how to work this.    
- multiple version management. link to specific versions      
- copy key.    
- oauth on joomla side so we can "push" installs

> Switch ext_name to Slug
> add dbd_name to artifacts       

- add more fields from manifests.
- generate artifacts from yaml seeds
